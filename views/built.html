<h2>Several islands and smaller skerries were included
   into a chain of isolated lighthouses, which significantly improved
   the navigation security on the main route to AÃ§ores.</h2>
   <p>The lightouse crew used to work in three-days shifts, rotating between the total of 23 lightouses
     which were co-founded by Norway, Iceland and Faeroers. The crews sailed in groups between the islands,
     either windsurfing in summer, or on yachts during the winter gales. This ensured a good balance
     between physical effort and a rather sedentary work of a lighthouse operator.
